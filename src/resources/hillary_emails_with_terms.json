Powell has spoken with Sarkozy, who remains supportive. The Socialists damaged Blair because they don't want a strong president and floated the Miliband as EU foreign secretary story in order to undermine Tony further. Powell (and Tony) appreciates Bill's willingness to write an op-ed, but understands why it couldn't be published. Merkel remains the key. Having been for Tony, she is now neutral, but still favorably inclined and doesn't know what to do. A nonentity as president would not appeal to her. Your conversation with her remains important.

Along with the food (which was great!) I really appreciated the chance to sit down with everyone informally and just chat and eat. While we work with each person here on an individual basis, it is rare to have the opportunity for all of us to be in the same place at the same time with no formal agenda. You have assembled a great team -- which has both an abundance of smarts and personality — and I'm grateful that we had a chance to see each other one more time before we all dispersed for the holidays.

Brilliant pick. Every time I meet with her I like her more and more and she is really the right pick for ECA. She brings so much to the table that we need. Everyone here is so pleased with the selection and the fact that R is equally pleased is even better —that we can both think she is \"ours\" is a testament to Ann. It may have taken a long time but it will be well worth the wait. She can take ECA in a new direction. And if she has the help of Joe Macmanus she can do it even quicker and better (I can't pass up a good plug opportunity!).

The French authorities have, since then, been entirely satisfied with the cooperation between our two countries and, beyond that, the continuous coordination between the Crises Centers of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs and the U.S. Department of State. They want to pay tribute to the United States' extraordinary mobilization efforts in support of Haiti and the vital role it is playing on the ground.

The comments by Assad during a one-day visit to Tehran followed talks with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Both leaders pledged to support \"resistance\" in the region, an apparent reference to Palestinian militants and others opposing Israel.
